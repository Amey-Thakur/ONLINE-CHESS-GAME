<!-- OVERVIEW -->
## Overview

This project involves the development of a sophisticated **Online Chess Game**, engineered as a comprehensive case study in interactive system design and user-centric architecture. The implementation prioritizes fundamental Human-Machine Interaction (HMI) principles, specifically focusing on **direct manipulation** and **immediate visual feedback** to ensure a seamless mental model for the user.

The system leverages a responsive design framework to maintain interaction consistency across diverse device orientations. At its core, the application integrates complex algorithmic structures for **real-time move validation** and state management, demonstrating the practical application of usability engineering metrics. This project serves as an exploration into the synergy between high-performance back-end logic and intuitive front-end layouts, aiming to optimize the overall **User Experience (UX)** through iterative design and evaluation.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Academic Context**
>
> This project was developed as a **Mini-Project** for the **Human-Machine Interaction Laboratory**, exploring the practical application of usability principles in game design.
