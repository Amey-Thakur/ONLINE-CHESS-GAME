<!-- OVERVIEW -->
## Overview

This project involves the development of a sophisticated **Online Chess Game**, engineered as a comprehensive case study in interactive system design and user-centric architecture. The implementation prioritizes fundamental Human-Machine Interaction (HMI) principles, specifically focusing on **direct manipulation** and **immediate visual feedback** to ensure a seamless mental model for the user.

The system leverages a responsive design framework to maintain interaction consistency across diverse device orientations. At its core, the application integrates complex algorithmic structures for **real-time move validation** and state management, demonstrating the practical application of usability engineering metrics. This project serves as an exploration into the synergy between high-performance back-end logic and intuitive front-end layouts, aiming to optimize the overall **User Experience (UX)** through iterative design and evaluation.

> [!NOTE]
> **Academic Context**
>
> This project was developed as a **Mini-Project** for the **Human-Machine Interaction Laboratory**, exploring the practical application of usability principles in game design. The scholarly documentation is archived on **ResearchGate**.

<!-- QUICK START -->
## Quick Start

### 1. Prerequisites
Ensure your local development environment meets the following technical requirements:
- **Runtime Environment**: Node.js **14.x** (LTS) or higher.
- **Package Manager**: npm (v6.x+) for dependency resolution.
- **Browser**: Modern web browser with WebSocket support (Chrome, Firefox, Edge).

> [!WARNING]
> **Technical Dependencies & Environment**
>
> This system is built using **Node.js 14+** and **Socket.IO 2.x**. For stable execution and educational reference, ensure your browser supports WebSocket connections. It is recommended to run this in a controlled development environment to align with the baseline real-time communication framework requirements.

### 2. Setup & Deployment
1.  **Repository Cloning**:
    Download the project assets to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Amey-Thakur/ONLINE-CHESS-GAME.git
    cd ONLINE-CHESS-GAME
    ```
2.  **Dependency Resolution**:
    Install the required Node.js packages as defined in the manifest:
    ```bash
    cd "Source Code"
    npm install
    ```

### 3. Execution Integration
1.  **Server Initialization**:
    Launch the backend server to establish the Socket.IO gateway:
    ```bash
    node app.js
    ```
    *The console should indicate: `Server is up on port 3000!`*

2.  **User Interface Access**:
    Open the application in your web browser to initialize the client session:
    -   **Local Gateway**: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
